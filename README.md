# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption
Image encryption and decryption refer to the process of converting an image into an unreadable format using encryption techniques so that only authorized parties can access the original image. The encrypted image can then be transmitted or stored securely without the risk of unauthorized access.

The process of decryption involves converting the encrypted image back to its original format using a decryption key or algorithm. This allows authorized parties to access and view the image.

Encryption and decryption are important in ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive images, such as those containing personal or confidential information. It is commonly used in various applications, such as online file sharing, secure communication, and data storage.
